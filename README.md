# Clickbait Classification
This project was the final project for the class COSI114a: Fundamentals of Natural Processing I at Brandeis University. It is very simple and attempts to solve the problem of clickbait classification with a selection of hand-crafted features and three different models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM.
